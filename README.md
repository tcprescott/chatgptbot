# ChatGPTBot

This is a very simple Discord bot that takes input from a specific channel and creates chat completitions using OpenAI's API (using the GPT3 Turbo model).  This was for an April Fools gag, but the code is here if anyone wants to mess with it themselves.

You'll need your own API key from OpenAI, and there is an expense to using it, so be careful.
